# Vet
Full stack Veterinary application using Html, Bootstrap, CSS and Javascritp

Vet is a web application of a veterinary clinic, at the moment you can only create and delete pets, veterinarians and pet owners, it means everything related to the frontend, the backend will be implemented in the future using Nodejs possibly.

It does not have any library, it can be run by opening index.html from any browser.

It should be clarified, any suggestion is welcome :)
